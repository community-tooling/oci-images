# semaphore

[Semaphore](https://github.com/NickColley/semaphore) is an accessible, simple and fast web client for Mastodon.

The upstream project does not provide a Docker image, so this repo automatically builds and releases an image for each new upstream release. The container runs nginx and listens on port 80.
